commonality
===========

Application application for my IMS application, by Grant Addis.

Queries the Wesleyan Student Directory and interprets results based on the frequency of first names among the student body.

To run, clone the project, then:
```
$ cd commonality
$ ruby commonality.rb
```
The program's usage should be pretty straightforward from there.
